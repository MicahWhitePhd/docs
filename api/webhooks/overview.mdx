## Introduction

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP callbacks when events occur in your Outcry AI account. This is particularly useful for video generation, where processing can take 60-90 seconds.

## Use Cases

- **Video Generation**: Get notified when videos complete or fail
- **Chat Completion**: Receive updates when long-running chat requests finish
- **Error Handling**: Be alerted when API errors occur

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Register** a webhook endpoint with your desired event types
2. **Receive** POST requests to your endpoint when events occur
3. **Verify** the webhook signature to ensure authenticity
4. **Process** the event data in your application

## Supported Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `video.completed` | Video generation finished successfully |
| `video.failed` | Video generation failed |
| `video.expired` | Video URL expired (after 1 hour on OpenAI) |
| `chat.completed` | Chat completion finished |
| `chat.failed` | Chat completion failed |

## Security

All webhook requests include:
- **Signature Header**: `X-Outcry-Signature` with HMAC-SHA256 signature
- **Timestamp Header**: `X-Outcry-Timestamp` to prevent replay attacks
- **Secret**: Unique webhook secret provided on creation
