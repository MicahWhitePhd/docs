# Welcome to Outcry AI API

Build powerful activist tools with AI-powered video generation, chat, and text generation - all accessible through a simple, OpenAI-compatible API.

## What is Outcry AI?

Outcry AI is an AI platform designed specifically for activists, organizers, and change-makers. Our API provides:

- **AI Video Generation**: Create compelling activist videos in seconds using Sora 2 and Sora 2 Pro models
- **Theory-Aware Chat**: Conversational AI that understands activist strategy through Theory of Change positioning
- **Text Generation**: Create activist content optimized for your strategic approach

## Why Outcry AI?

### 🎯 Built for Activists
Unlike generic AI platforms, Outcry AI understands activist strategy. Use our Theory of Change system to align AI outputs with your strategic framework - whether you're focused on grassroots mobilization, policy reform, culture change, or spiritual activism.

### 🔌 OpenAI SDK Compatible
Already using OpenAI? Switch to Outcry AI by changing just one line - your `baseURL`. All your existing code works immediately with TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, .NET, and PHP SDKs.

### 💰 Transparent Pricing
Pay for what you use with prepaid credits:
- **Videos**: $1.25 - $18 per video (4-12 seconds, multiple quality tiers)
- **Chat & Text**: $0.08 per 1,000 tokens
- No subscriptions, no hidden fees

### 🔒 Privacy First
Your data, your control. All API requests are authenticated, rate-limited, and tracked for your analytics. Webhook notifications keep you informed of video completions.

## Quick Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Just change the baseURL!
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'oc_live_...',
  baseURL: 'https://api.outcryai.com/v1'
});

// Generate an activist video
const video = await client.videos.create({
  model: 'sora-2',
  prompt: 'Activists marching for climate justice',
  seconds: '8',
  size: '1280x720'
});

console.log(`Video created: ${video.id}`);
console.log(`Status: ${video.status}`);
```
