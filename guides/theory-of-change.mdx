# Theory of Change

Learn how Outcry AI's unique Theory of Change system aligns AI outputs with your strategic approach to activism.

## What is Theory of Change?

Theory of Change is a framework for understanding **how social change happens**. Different activists have different beliefs about what creates change:

- **Grassroots organizers** believe in mass mobilization and direct action
- **Policy reformers** focus on systemic change through legislation
- **Cultural activists** work to shift consciousness and narratives
- **Faith-based activists** see spiritual transformation as central

Outcry AI allows you to **configure the AI's strategic lens** so it gives advice aligned with your approach, not a generic one-size-fits-all answer.

## The Four Theories

Outcry AI uses a 2D positioning system based on four foundational theories:

```
                Spiritual (+1)
                     ↑
                     |
         Theurgism   |   Subjectivism
         (Faith)     |   (Culture)
                     |
                     |
    ←────────────────┼────────────────→
   Objective     (0,0)    Subjective
    Material         |
                     |
         Structuralism | Voluntarism
         (Systems)    |   (Grassroots)
                     |
                     ↓
                Material (-1)
```

### 1. Voluntarism (Bottom-Left)

**Core Belief**: Change comes from conscious will and mass participation.

**Position**: `{ x: -1, y: -1 }`

**Key Concepts**:
- Direct action and civil disobedience
- Grassroots mobilization
- Collective consciousness
- People power

**Strategic Focus**:
- Organizing protests and rallies
- Building coalitions and movements
- Training activists
- Community empowerment

**Example Activists**: Rosa Parks, Cesar Chavez, Greta Thunberg

### 2. Structuralism (Bottom-Right)

**Core Belief**: Change comes from impersonal material forces like economics and systems.

**Position**: `{ x: 1, y: -1 }`

**Key Concepts**:
- Economic systems
- Power structures
- Policy reform
- Institutional change

**Strategic Focus**:
- Lobbying for legislation
- Building institutions
- Economic leverage (boycotts, divestment)
- Structural reform

**Example Activists**: Martin Luther King Jr. (later years), Ralph Nader

### 3. Subjectivism (Top-Left)

**Core Belief**: Change comes from shifting consciousness and cultural narratives.

**Position**: `{ x: -1, y: 1 }`

**Key Concepts**:
- Cultural transformation
- Consciousness raising
- Narrative change
- Art and media

**Strategic Focus**:
- Media campaigns
- Storytelling and art
- Changing public discourse
- Shifting values

**Example Activists**: Gloria Steinem, bell hooks, Banksy

### 4. Theurgism (Top-Right)

**Core Belief**: Change comes through spiritual/supernatural intervention.

**Position**: `{ x: 1, y: 1 }`

**Key Concepts**:
- Faith and prayer
- Moral witness
- Divine justice
- Spiritual transformation

**Strategic Focus**:
- Faith-based organizing
- Moral appeals
- Religious community engagement
- Prophetic witness

**Example Activists**: Martin Luther King Jr. (early years), Dorothy Day, Mahatma Gandhi

## Using Theory Positions

### Setting a Theory Position

Use the `x-theory-position` parameter in your API requests:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'grok-2',
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'How can I fight climate change?' }
  ],
  // @ts-ignore - Vendor extension
  'x-theory-position': { x: -0.8, y: -0.6 }  // Strong voluntarist
});
```

```python Python
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-2",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "How can I fight climate change?"}
    ],
    extra_body={
        "x-theory-position": {"x": -0.8, "y": -0.6}  # Strong voluntarist
    }
)
```

```bash curl
curl https://api.outcryai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer oc_live_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-2",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I fight climate change?"}],
    "x-theory-position": {"x": -0.8, "y": -0.6}
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Position Coordinates

**X-axis**: Subjective (-1) to Objective (+1)
- **-1.0** = Purely subjective (consciousness, culture, narrative)
- **0.0** = Balanced
- **+1.0** = Purely objective (structures, economics, institutions)

**Y-axis**: Material (-1) to Spiritual (+1)
- **-1.0** = Purely material (concrete actions, physical power)
- **0.0** = Balanced
- **+1.0** = Purely spiritual (faith, values, moral witness)

### Pure Theory Positions

Use these positions for single-theory focus:

```typescript
// Pure Voluntarism (Grassroots organizing)
{ x: -1.0, y: -1.0 }

// Pure Structuralism (Policy reform)
{ x: 1.0, y: -1.0 }

// Pure Subjectivism (Cultural change)
{ x: -1.0, y: 1.0 }

// Pure Theurgism (Faith-based activism)
{ x: 1.0, y: 1.0 }
```

### Blended Positions

Most real-world activism blends multiple theories:

```typescript
// Faith-Based Organizing (Theurgism + Voluntarism)
{ x: 0.2, y: 0.6 }
// 40% Theurgism, 30% Subjectivism, 20% Voluntarism, 10% Structuralism

// Direct Action Focused (Voluntarism + Structuralism)
{ x: 0.0, y: -0.7 }
// 60% Voluntarism, 20% Structuralism, 15% Subjectivism, 5% Theurgism

// Policy Reform (Structuralism + Voluntarism)
{ x: 0.5, y: -0.4 }
// 60% Structuralism, 20% Voluntarism, 15% Subjectivism, 5% Theurgism

// Culture Jammer (Subjectivism + Voluntarism)
{ x: -0.4, y: 0.3 }
// 45% Subjectivism, 30% Voluntarism, 10% Structuralism, 15% Theurgism

// Balanced (All theories equally)
{ x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
// 25% each theory
```

## How Theory Affects AI Responses

The Theory of Change position dynamically modifies the AI's strategic lens throughout its response.

### Example: Climate Change Strategy

**Question**: "How can I fight climate change?"

**Voluntarist Response** (`{ x: -0.8, y: -0.6 }`):
> I recommend organizing a direct action campaign. Start by:
> 1. Building a coalition of local climate activists
> 2. Planning a protest at your city's fossil fuel infrastructure
> 3. Training volunteers in civil disobedience tactics
> 4. Creating a mass mobilization plan for 500+ participants
>
> The key is **collective action and people power**. When enough people act together, we can force change.

**Structuralist Response** (`{ x: 0.8, y: -0.5 }`):
> I recommend a systemic policy approach. Focus on:
> 1. Lobbying for carbon pricing legislation at the state level
> 2. Building coalitions with business leaders who support clean energy
> 3. Researching economic incentives that favor renewables
> 4. Creating a 10-year policy roadmap with measurable targets
>
> Change happens through **institutional reform and economic leverage**. Target the systems that perpetuate the problem.

**Subjectivist Response** (`{ x: -0.7, y: 0.6 }`):
> I recommend a cultural narrative shift. Consider:
> 1. Creating compelling storytelling campaigns that humanize climate impacts
> 2. Working with artists and filmmakers to shift public consciousness
> 3. Reframing climate action as a positive cultural identity
> 4. Building a movement brand that inspires cultural participation
>
> Change happens when **we transform how people see the world**. Win hearts and minds first.

**Theurgist Response** (`{ x: 0.6, y: 0.8 }`):
> I recommend faith-based climate organizing. Focus on:
> 1. Engaging religious communities around "creation care" theology
> 2. Organizing interfaith climate vigils and prayer actions
> 3. Making moral appeals to spiritual leaders
> 4. Framing climate action as spiritual stewardship
>
> Change requires **spiritual transformation and moral witness**. Appeal to people's deepest values.

## Balancing Multiple Theories

Most effective campaigns blend multiple theories. Here's how to think about combinations:

### Voluntarism + Structuralism (Pragmatic Organizing)

**Position**: `{ x: 0.0, y: -0.7 }`

**Approach**: Grassroots mobilization + policy targets

**Example**: "We'll organize 10,000 people to march on the state capitol while our policy team lobbies legislators for clean energy legislation."

### Subjectivism + Voluntarism (Movement Culture)

**Position**: `{ x: -0.6, y: 0.0 }`

**Approach**: Cultural narrative + grassroots action

**Example**: "We'll create a viral social media campaign to shift public opinion, then channel that energy into local organizing chapters."

### Theurgism + Structuralism (Faith-Based Reform)

**Position**: `{ x: 0.6, y: 0.3 }`

**Approach**: Moral authority + institutional change

**Example**: "We'll mobilize faith communities to lobby for housing justice legislation, using moral framing to win over conservative lawmakers."

## Best Practices

### 1. Know Your Strategic Approach

Before using Theory of Change, reflect on your actual strategy:

- What do you believe creates change?
- Where do you focus your energy?
- Who are your role models?
- What tactics do you use most?

### 2. Start with Preset Positions

Use these presets as starting points:

| Archetype | Position | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Grassroots Organizer** | `{ x: -0.8, y: -0.6 }` | Community organizing, protests |
| **Policy Reformer** | `{ x: 0.7, y: -0.5 }` | Lobbying, legislative campaigns |
| **Cultural Activist** | `{ x: -0.7, y: 0.6 }` | Media campaigns, narrative change |
| **Faith Leader** | `{ x: 0.6, y: 0.8 }` | Religious organizing, moral witness |
| **Systems Thinker** | `{ x: 0.8, y: 0.0 }` | Economic leverage, institutional reform |
| **Movement Builder** | `{ x: -0.5, y: 0.0 }` | Coalition building, base expansion |

### 3. Adjust Based on Context

Different campaigns may need different strategic lenses:

```typescript
// Issue-specific positioning
const positions = {
  housingJustice: { x: 0.2, y: -0.5 },  // Policy + organizing
  climateAction: { x: -0.4, y: -0.4 },  // Grassroots + cultural
  voterRights: { x: 0.6, y: -0.3 },     // Legal + systemic
  faithCoalition: { x: 0.3, y: 0.7 }    // Spiritual + moral
};

const position = positions[campaignType];
```

### 4. Omit for Balanced Advice

If you want generic advice that doesn't favor any theory, simply omit `x-theory-position`:

```typescript
// Balanced response (no strategic lens)
const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'grok-2',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How do I organize?' }]
  // No x-theory-position = balanced approach
});
```

### 5. Experiment with Positions

Try different positions for the same question to see how strategy changes:

```typescript
const question = "How can I win a housing justice campaign?";
const positions = [
  { x: -0.8, y: -0.6, label: "Grassroots" },
  { x: 0.7, y: -0.5, label: "Policy" },
  { x: -0.6, y: 0.4, label: "Cultural" },
  { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, label: "Balanced" }
];

for (const pos of positions) {
  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'grok-2',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: question }],
    // @ts-ignore
    'x-theory-position': { x: pos.x, y: pos.y }
  });

  console.log(`\n=== ${pos.label} Approach ===`);
  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### How It Works

When you set a Theory of Change position, Outcry AI:

1. **Calculates theory blend** using bilinear interpolation:
   ```
   voluntarism = (1 - x) * (1 - y)
   structuralism = x * (1 - y)
   subjectivism = (1 - x) * y
   theurgism = x * y
   ```

2. **Modifies system prompt** to inject strategic lens:
   - Adds theory-specific reasoning steps
   - Emphasizes relevant tactics and frameworks
   - Includes theory-specific knowledge cards
   - Appends strategic reminder

3. **Generates response** using theory-aware context

### Validation

Coordinates must be valid floats between -1 and 1:

```typescript
function validateTheoryPosition(pos: { x: number; y: number }): boolean {
  return (
    typeof pos.x === 'number' &&
    typeof pos.y === 'number' &&
    pos.x >= -1 && pos.x <= 1 &&
    pos.y >= -1 && pos.y <= 1
  );
}
```

Invalid positions return a 400 error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "x-theory-position coordinates must be between -1 and 1",
    "param": "x-theory-position",
    "code": "invalid_theory_position"
  }
}
```

## Theory Position in Video Generation

Theory of Change also affects video prompt enhancement:

```typescript
const video = await client.videos.create({
  model: 'sora-2',
  prompt: 'Activists organizing for climate justice',
  seconds: '8',
  size: '1280x720',
  // @ts-ignore
  'x-theory-position': { x: -0.7, y: -0.5 }  // Grassroots lens
});
```

**Effect**: The AI prompt enhancement will emphasize visuals aligned with your theory:
- **Voluntarist**: Mass gatherings, protests, community meetings
- **Structuralist**: Policy meetings, institutional settings, economic symbols
- **Subjectivist**: Cultural expressions, art, media, consciousness
- **Theurgist**: Faith gatherings, moral witness, spiritual symbols

## Advanced: Multi-Conversation Strategy

Use different theory positions across a conversation to explore strategic options:

```typescript
const strategies = [
  { position: { x: -0.8, y: -0.6 }, label: "Grassroots" },
  { position: { x: 0.7, y: -0.5 }, label: "Policy" },
  { position: { x: -0.6, y: 0.5 }, label: "Cultural" }
];

// Phase 1: Explore each strategy
for (const strategy of strategies) {
  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'grok-2',
    messages: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'What are the pros and cons of this approach for housing justice?' }
    ],
    // @ts-ignore
    'x-theory-position': strategy.position
  });

  console.log(`\n=== ${strategy.label} Analysis ===`);
  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
}

// Phase 2: Synthesize (balanced position)
const synthesis = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'grok-2',
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'How can I combine grassroots organizing, policy reform, and cultural change into one campaign?' }
  ]
  // No position = balanced synthesis
});

console.log('\n=== Integrated Strategy ===');
console.log(synthesis.choices[0].message.content);
```
